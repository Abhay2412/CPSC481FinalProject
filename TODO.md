## TA's Feedback: 
- [ ] Weather Tab Placement: Consider placing the weather tab in a separate side card since it's not immediately relevant to bus information.
- [ ] Payment Screen: Add an "edit" or "back" button for user convenience. Clarify instructions like "Follow directions on the terminal."
- [ ] Purchase Successful Screen: Instead of just saying "tickets below," add a picture of an actual "ticket pocket" for user guidance.
- [ ] Route Information Screen: Clarify how users access this screen. Consider moving the "number of stops" to more info and emphasizing bus interval.
- [ ] Refund Pages: Make the help button more prominent. Include contact numbers on the page if the return fails.
- [ ] Layout and Alignment: Requires improvement for better visual appeal and user experience.
